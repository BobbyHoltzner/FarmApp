## Installation

### Android

1. Clone repository, cd into the directory.
2. Run the command npm install, this will install all dependencies.
3. Open your emulator
  ** Currently this only works with certain devices (tablets mainly, Nexus 9-10 with api 21-22)
4. Run the following command in the terminal "react-native run-android"
5. Open a new terminal and run the following command "react-native start"
6. The app should be running, you may have to click the Reload JS button on the emulator if you receive the red error screen.
7. Currently all code is within the index.android.js file, my API key is in there.
